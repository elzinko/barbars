<h2>What is Handlebars?</h2>
<a>

  templates effectively. It provides the power necessary to let you build
  semantic templates, with a minimal learning curve. You can easily bind data to
  your UI, create reusable components, and manipulate your DOM, all while
  keeping your code clean and maintainable.
